#KNN Analytics

This python script compares speed and accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm with different distance functions.

The algorithm has been applied on MNIST data- a collection of 42000 handwritten digit (0-9) images.

The final cell of the jupyter notebook provides a summary of the result.

Inference:
**Weighted K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm with Hellinger Distance** provides the best accuracy.
Time difference among methods was found to be negligible.
